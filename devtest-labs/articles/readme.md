In this folder you will find a number of tutorials that relate to common activities when working with DevTest. This includes:

* A walkthrough under the persona of IT or another user that may implement cost-control and governance policies in your lab environment
* A walkthrough under the persona of a Developer or Tester that will use the lab environment for their day to day activities

More walkthroughs are being added over time, so keep an eye out for new additions.
